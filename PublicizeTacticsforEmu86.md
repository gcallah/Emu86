Publicize Tactics for Emu86

Posted in two Facebook groups: Ladies Storm Hackathon and Hackathon Hackers
I posted pictures and asked members to spread word and try about the application.
I tried to search for other assembly Facebook groups but they were mostly inactive. 

Worked with Professor Sandoval to improve application to demo for Intro to OS students.

Created a Youtube video -- a tutorial regarding how to navigate and code for the website.

Emailed Professor Frankl in regards to whether she has any advice on how to publicize the product. 

Emailed Thomas Caswell, a developer for Matplotlib, for advice regarding how to publicize.
He however said that he joined Matplotlib when it was already well established and does not have experience in publicizing.

Signed up for SIGCSE as a student, joined the SIGCSE-member mailing list.
Emailed the SIGCSE-member list about whether they would be interested in being users for either the website or the Jupyter kernel.

Emailed Professor Tan in regards to whether he would be interested in using Emu86 for Computer Architecture class.
He said that he has already moved past MIPS in the course, but will spread the word about Emu.
