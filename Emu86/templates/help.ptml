            This is an open source project written by Gene Callahan,
            Abhishek Ramchandran, Varun Chopra, and Nathan Conroy.
            The goal is to create a simple learning tool to introduce students to
            assembly language programming in a class on, say, operating systems
            or compilers, where the focus is not assembly language, and actually
            using an assembler would be a distraction from the main theme of the
            course. It includes a (growing) subset of x86 assembler
            instructions. (This is, by the way, Intel assembly language, and
            not AT&amp;T assembly language.)
            </p>

        <h2>
            Instructions Available
        </h2>
            <p>
                Some of these are only partially done, i.e., some variant of
                an instruciton may not work. We will do our best to note that
                where possible.
                <br>
                In the syntax descriptions, we have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>con: constant
                <li>lbl: label
                <li>mem: memory location
                    <br>
                    A memory location may be designated by [num], where
                    <i>num</i> is the actual address, or by [reg], where
                    <i>reg</i> holds the memory address.
                <li>reg: register
            </ul>
