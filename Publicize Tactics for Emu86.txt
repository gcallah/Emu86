Publicize Tactics for Emu86

Posted in two Facebook groups: Ladies Storm Hackathon and Hackathon Hackers
I posted pictures and asked members to spread word and try about the application.
I tried to search for other assembly Facebook groups but they were mostly inactive. 

Worked with Professor Sandoval to improve application to demo for Intro to OS students.

Created a Youtube video -- a tutorial regarding how to navigate and code for the website.
